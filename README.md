## Welcome to RefurboCloud üîßüì¶

RefurboCloud is a comprehensive microservice-based application tailored for **laptop refurbishing businesses**, showcasing **end-to-end DevOps automation** with deep **observability powered by OpenTelemetry**.

### Key Highlights

- **Domain-Focused**: Tracks the lifecycle of refurbished laptops, including diagnostics, repair, testing, listing, and order processing.
- **Observability-First**: Every microservice is instrumented with OpenTelemetry for traces, logs, and metrics.
- **DevOps Integrated**: CI/CD pipelines, monitoring, auto-scaling, and log aggregation are built-in using cloud-native tools.
- **Vendor-Ready**: Plug-and-play compatibility with popular observability platforms and monitoring solutions.

---

## Project Goals

- Demonstrate how OpenTelemetry can be used to monitor and observe every component in a production-grade refurbishing pipeline.
- Provide an example architecture for cloud-native DevOps in retail/repair-tech industries.
- Serve as a base platform for vendors and SREs to test observability tools on realistic workloads.

---

## Quick Start üöÄ

You can be up and running with RefurboCloud in just a few steps:

- [Docker Setup](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/demo/docker_deployment/)
- [Kubernetes Setup](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/demo/kubernetes_deployment/)

Each deployment includes:

- Instrumented microservices (Inventory, Diagnostics, Repair, Testing, E-Commerce Portal)
- OpenTelemetry Collector, Prometheus, Grafana
- Logging and tracing pipelines via OTLP

## üß© Microservices Overview

This system is composed of modular microservices that together form a robust, local e-commerce simulation platform for refurbished laptops.
All services were **successfully built and edited on 02-06-2025 for local use**.

### üõçÔ∏è Commerce & User Interaction

* **`frontend`**:
  Main user interface for customers, built as a responsive e-commerce web application.

* **`cart`**:
  Manages shopping cart sessions, item additions/removals, and updates in real-time.

* **`checkout`**:
  Handles the checkout process including validation, order confirmation, and transition to payment.

* **`order-service`**:
  Processes customer orders and manages the flow from order placement to shipment.

* **`payment`**:
  Manages payment transactions, validations, and integrations with simulated gateways.

* **`currency`**:
  Provides currency formatting and conversion logic, supporting global pricing models.

* **`email`**:
  Sends transactional and notification emails like order confirmations and shipment updates.

* **`recommendation`**:
  Suggests relevant refurbished products based on user behavior and historical data.

* **`quote`**:
  Generates dynamic pricing and offers for selected laptop models or configurations.

### üßæ Business & Operations

* **`accounting`**:
  Tracks financial transactions, invoices, and reporting for business operations.

* **`ad`**:
  Handles advertisement display and tracking within the platform.

  ‚úÖ **Final CI/CD check completed ‚Äì 3 weeks ago**

* **`shipping`**:
  Calculates shipping logistics, timelines, and manages dispatch tracking.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Infrastructure & Observability

* **`otel-collector`**:
  Collects and exports telemetry data (metrics, logs, traces) to observability tools.

* **`prometheus`**:
  Monitors services and gathers performance metrics across the platform.

* **`grafana`**:
  Visualizes service metrics and dashboards from Prometheus and OpenTelemetry sources.

* **`flagd`** and **`flagd-ui`**:
  Provide feature flag management and a UI to toggle features at runtime.

* **`frontend-proxy`**:
  Acts as a reverse proxy for routing frontend requests to appropriate backend services.

* **`kafka`**:
  Message broker facilitating event-driven communication between services.

* **`load-generator`**:
  Simulates user load and transactions for stress testing and benchmarking.

### üîí Risk & Quality Management

* **`fraud-detection`**:
