## Welcome to RefurboCloud üîßüì¶

RefurboCloud is a comprehensive microservice-based application tailored for **laptop refurbishing businesses**, showcasing **end-to-end DevOps automation** with deep **observability powered by OpenTelemetry**.

### Key Highlights

- **Domain-Focused**: Tracks the lifecycle of refurbished laptops, including diagnostics, repair, testing, listing, and order processing.
- **Observability-First**: Every microservice is instrumented with OpenTelemetry for traces, logs, and metrics.
- **DevOps Integrated**: CI/CD pipelines, monitoring, auto-scaling, and log aggregation are built-in using cloud-native tools.
- **Vendor-Ready**: Plug-and-play compatibility with popular observability platforms and monitoring solutions.

---

## Project Goals

- Demonstrate how OpenTelemetry can be used to monitor and observe every component in a production-grade refurbishing pipeline.
- Provide an example architecture for cloud-native DevOps in retail/repair-tech industries.
- Serve as a base platform for vendors and SREs to test observability tools on realistic workloads.

---

## Quick Start üöÄ

You can be up and running with RefurboCloud in just a few steps:

- [Docker Setup](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/demo/docker_deployment/)
- [Kubernetes Setup](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/demo/kubernetes_deployment/)

Each deployment includes:

- Instrumented microservices (Inventory, Diagnostics, Repair, Testing, E-Commerce Portal)
- OpenTelemetry Collector, Prometheus, Grafana
- Logging and tracing pipelines via OTLP

---

## RefurboCloud Architecture

This system includes services such as:

- `inventory-service`: Tracks incoming/outgoing refurbished laptops.
- `diagnostics-service`: Simulates diagnostic checks with telemetry events.
- `repair-service`: Coordinates hardware and software refurbishing.
- `qa-service`: Tests and verifies laptops before listing.
- `frontend`: E-commerce UI for customers.
- `order-service`: Handles purchase and logistics.
- `otel-collector`: Aggregates telemetry data and routes it to compatible backends.
